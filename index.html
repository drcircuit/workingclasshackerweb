        <h1 class="tk-neuropol-x-light">Who is the Working Class Hacker?</h1>
        <p>Hello World! My name is Espen. I live in Norway with my wife and three kids. I was born in 1979, sold my
            first piece of software in 1989, got engaged in 2001, married in 2002, entered fatherhood in 2008, 2010 and
            2013. </p>
        <p>Through the course of my life I have worked on countless software projects, spanning a vast majority of
            languages and platforms</p>
        <p>I got started out with a Commodore 64 that my older brother got in a trade. I was 6 years old at the time.
            And I would spend hours, days and weeks trying to learn as much as I could about that marvelous machine.</p>
        <p>Then I had a tiny pause from computing for a couple of years, but then I got my first 486, a SX 25! Me and my
            mother bought that thing together using her Christmas bonus.</p>
        <p>Ever since my first experience programming a computer, I have relentlessly kept going on my quest for
            all harvesting knowledge from as many corners of this wonderful world of software developemnt.</p>
        <p>I plan on sharing my experiences on my blog, however I will need to finish the blogging system first...</p>
    </div>
    <div id="work" class="page hidden">
        <h1 class="tk-neuropol-x-light">So since you are Working Class, where do you work?</h1>
        <p>I currently work @ a company called Compello AS</p>
        <p>Compello is an ISV delivering solutions for banking systems, invoicing and EDI messaging. I think it is both fun and
            challenging @ the same time. And I love working together with my colleagues. </p>
        <p>There I make software, primarily on the .NET platform, using a bunch of different technologies. Our team is
            international and comprises of people in several countries throughout the world.</p>

    <div id="code" class="page hidden">
        <h1 class="tk-neuropol-x-light">Hacker? Show me code...</h1>
        <p>Ok let's first clear up the "Hacker" term. When I say hacker, I mean it in the original sense, not
            the malicious "pirate / cracker/ ha}{0R / bring down the establishment" kind of way. I mean it as a
            tinkerer,
            fiddler, someone who needs to figure out how stuff works, and how you can use that knowledge to transcend
            into
            other uses and functionality.</p>
        <p>Example: Larry Wall (creator of Perl) has a degree in Linguistics, because he was able to convince the
            university that
            computer programming qualifies as a language. His degree was the first linguistics degree in "Artificial
            Languages"
            I mean talk about hacking the system... You've gotta love that!
